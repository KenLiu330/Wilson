				<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
				<p>Ken: I found this racquet similar to my old one (Wilson Steam 100 BLX). It is lighter than the old one, but the best part is that it makes spinning way more easier for me.</p>

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<img class="feat-img" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TYL7LY84-No/maxresdefault.jpg">
				<p>Light, fast and very spin-friendly, the BLX Juice from Wilson is well suited to the modern aggressive player. As you'll see from the comments below, our testers found easy access to pace and depth thanks to a generous sweetspot. Our team put the power to best use on serve, where everyone found impressive pace and spin. However, control and placement suffered somewhat at the hands of this racquet's power, with control best improved via the use of heavy spin. Light and mobile at net, the BLX Juice 100 proved quick and easy to get into position, but did lack some stability when up against harder hit passing attempts. Stronger players may want to consider beefing this one up with some lead tape, but fans of lighter racquets will revel in how quick and easy this racquet is to get around. For maximum comfort we suggest using a multifilament like Wilson NXT 17. Those seeking to increase control and get really insane spin should opt for a monofilament like Luxilon ALU Power. However you string it, the BLX Juice 100 is a light and spin-friendly option best suited to players at the 3.5+ levels.</p>
